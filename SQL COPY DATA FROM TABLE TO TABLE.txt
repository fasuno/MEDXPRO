Before you begin to copy data from one table to another, make sure that the data types in the destination columns are compatible with the data types of the source columns

Right-click the Query Editor, and then click Design Query in Editor.

In the Add Table dialog box, select the source and destination table, click Add, and then close the Add Table dialog box.

Right-click an open area of the Query Editor, point to Change Type, and then click Insert Results.
